It is similar in function to the N95 respirator mask widely used in healthcare settings. The KN in KN95 stands for Chinese standard, indicating that it meets the standards set by China's National Health Commission for filtering out at least 95% of airborne particles. KN95 masks are commonly used for protection against particulate matter such as dust, smoke, and various airborne pollutants. They have become particularly popular during health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic as a tool for reducing the transmission of respiratory viruses.",
